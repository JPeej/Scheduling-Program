# Scheduling-Program

# Introduction

This is a school project for an advanced software class based in Java. I have been tasked to create a desktop scheduling application as a solution for a fictional company. This project will challenge my education up to this point and verify that the foundations of programming have been learned. I am looking forward to work on this project.

# Scenario

The following situation is the one I must place myself in. It lays out a semi-realistic professional project that I must complete.

I am a developer within a software company that has been hired to create the desktop scheduling program. We were hired by a global organization that has business in Arizona, New York, Montreal, and England. The organization has provided their MySQL database in which the program built must interact with. The database may not be modified as it is already tied into other systems.

Requirements and other various Initialization phase documentation has already been completed. Requirements can be found in the respective file.
